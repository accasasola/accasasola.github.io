How to create a github page:  
Create a repo, clone the repo in your local workscpace, name your project and add index.html, add the file, commit the changes and finally push it.  

My key takeaway from this is it's easier to add, push and commit changes to the repo through vs code, especially when it's confusing to do it using git bash, I also learned about creating flex boxes in html something that I already forgot from csmc 12.
